# AIM - axisymmetric inversion method

Code for computing equilibrium axisymmetric phase-space distribution function. It provides highly efficent and user-friendly implementation of an algorithm presented in [Hunter \& Qian](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/262/2/401/1161204), [Qian et al.](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/274/2/602/2896126) and [Petac \& Ullio](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.043003). The code is written in C++, however, it can be also be deployed from Python using the provided pybind11 wrapper.
